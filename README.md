### Hi I'm Jesse 👋🏼

🤘🏼 I'm a MIS graduate from The University of Texas at Austin currently working for Barclays as a Technology Analyst  

🌱 I'm currently enrolled in Codesmith, a full-stack coding boot camp where I've gotten experience working with technologies such as React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and much more!  

😄 Below are some of my projects. Feel free to get in contact if you have any questions!
