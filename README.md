### Hi I'm Jesse 👋🏼

🤘🏼 I'm a Management Information Systems graduate from The University of Texas at Austin.

🧑🏻‍💻 Currently, I work as a Technology Analyst for [Barclays](https://barclays.com/). I previously worked for [Scholastic](https://www.scholastic.com/home), [Yext](https://yext.com/), and [NBCUniversal](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/).

🌱 I'm currently enrolled in Codesmith, a full-stack coding boot camp where I've gotten experience working with technologies such as Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and much more!  

😄 Below are some projects I've worked on. Feel free to get in contact if you have any questions!
