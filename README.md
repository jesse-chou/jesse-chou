### Hi I'm Jesse 👋🏼

🤘🏼 I'm a Management Information Systems graduate from The University of Texas at Austin

🧑🏻‍💻 Currently, I work as a Technology Analyst for [Barclays]([url](https://barclays.com/)). I previously worked for [Scholastic]([url](https://www.scholastic.com/home)), [Yext]([url](https://yext.com/)), and [NBCUniversal]([url](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/))

🌱 I'm currently enrolled in Codesmith, a full-stack coding boot camp where I've gotten experience working with technologies such as React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and much more!  

😄 Below are some projects I've worked on. Feel free to get in contact if you have any questions!
